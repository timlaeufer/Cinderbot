[Open Game Prompts]
og_howto = `Welp {name}'
og_format = 
	Format: 
	`.opengame (public/private) (name without spaces, use _) (channel_1_name) (channel_2_name) ....`
	
	If you put a `v-` in front of the channel name, I'll make it a voice channel!
	
	By default, only people with the assigned role are able to talk in the voice channels.
	
	Example:
	`.opengame public Cinderbrush v-talks general planning memes visitor`
	
	creates a role called 'Cinderbrush', which can be assigned to the members.
	Then creates a category with the same name, and adds a voicechannel 'talks', and four text channels called 'general', 'planning', 'memes', and 'visitor'.
	Channels with `visitor` in their name will be open for the public to chat in.
	
	if you put in mentions of other members in the opengame-command, they will be assigned the created role.

move_help: Hi! To use the .move feature of {me}, please use the following format:
	`.move <move name> <modifier)`
	
	`<move name>` can be `Beyond the Veil` or something else. The bot can deal with full sentenced and blanks in. It tries to find the best match if you dont exactly nail it. If you write the exact move name, you'll find it.
	
	The `<modifier>` is the modifier you roll with - that's only **if you roll**. You don\'t have to give a modifier to look up a move.
	`.move Beyond The Veil` gets the \'Beyond The Veil\'-Move from the Fae. If you add a `+2` anywhere, the bot knows that you're trying to roll and only shows you what you wanna know.
