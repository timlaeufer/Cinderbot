og_howto = `Welp {name}'
og_format = 
	Format: 
	`.opengame (public/private) (name without spaces, use _) (channel_1_name) (channel_2_name) ....`
	
	If you put a `v-` in front of the channel name, I'll make it a voice channel!
	
	By default, only people with the assigned role are able to talk in the voice channels.
	
	Example:
	`.opengame public Cinderbrush v-talks general planning memes visitor`
	
	creates a role called 'Cinderbrush', which can be assigned to the members.
	Then creates a category with the same name, and adds a voicechannel 'talks', and four text channels called 'general', 'planning', 'memes', and 'visitor'.
	Channels with `visitor` in their name will be open for the public to chat in.
	
	if you put in mentions of other members in the opengame-command, they will be assigned the created role.

	These are the channels I will create:
